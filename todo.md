## Current Issue: Frontend Login Connection Problem

**Problem**: Frontend shows "Connection to server failed" when trying to login, despite backend API working correctly via curl.

**Analysis**: 
- Backend running on port 5001 with proper CORS configuration
- Frontend running on port 5174 with debugging tools added
- API endpoint `/api/auth/login` works correctly when tested directly
- Issue appears to be browser-specific connection problem

## Immediate Tasks (Simple, incremental fixes)

### Phase 1: Improve Frontend Design & Fix Connection
- [x] 1. Design modern, professional UI with cool colors and gradients
- [x] 2. Implement responsive design with better spacing and typography
- [x] 3. Add modern login form with better visual hierarchy
- [x] 4. Create professional dashboard with modern cards and layouts

### Phase 3: Business Logic

## Next Steps
1. Before proceeding, verify this plan with the user
2. Focus only on the immediate login issue first
3. Make each change as simple and isolated as possible
4. Test after each change
5. Move to Phase 2 only after Phase 1 is complete
